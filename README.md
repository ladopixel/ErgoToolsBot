<h1>ErgoToolsBot</h1>
<p>ErgoToolsBot is a Telegram bot to receive real-time information from the Ergo blockchain.</p>
<p>The bot is working on a RaspberryPi 4 that has a 2x16 LCD screen connected showing me the username and ID.</p>
<p>This is the <a href="https://t.me/ErgoToolsBot" title="ErgoToolsBot Telegram">URL for Telegram @ErgoToolsBot.</a></p>

<p>
  I want to add new features little by little, for now this tool shows the following:
  <ul>
    <li><strong>/info</strong> (General information about Ergo's blockchain)</li>
    <li><strong>9fjff...hsLjf</strong> (Sending a message to the bot with a valid wallet shows the number of tokens and the balance in ERG)</li>
    <li><strong>1c471...e35df</strong> (Sending a message to the bot with the ID of a token will show us the name, amount issued, description and URL of the image, audio or video if it is a NFT.)</li>
  </ul>
</p>
