<h1>ErgoToolsBot</h1>
<p>ErgoToolsBot is a Telegram bot to receive real-time information from the Ergo blockchain.</p>
<p>The bot is working on a RaspberryPi 4 that has a 2x16 LCD screen connected showing me the username, id and some more information about the queries that are made.</p>

<h2>ErgoToolsBot does not store anything in the database.</h2>
<p>I want to add new features little by little, for now this tool shows the following:</p>
  <ul>
    <li><strong>/start</strong> (Greetings from ErgoToolsBot)</li>
    <li><strong>/info</strong> (General information about Ergo's blockchain)</li>
    <li><strong>/instructions</strong> (General information about ErgoToolsBot)</li>
   <li><strong>/credits</strong> (Technology used)</li>
  </ul>
    
<p>You can send a message to the bot with a valid wallet it shows the amount of tokens and the balance in ERG</p>
<p>You can send a message to the bot with the ID of a token will show us the name, amount issued, description and URL of the image, audio or video if it is a NFT</p>

<p>Remember that you can contribute to improve the code whenever you want.</p>
